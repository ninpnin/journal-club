    <h3>2024-04-18 – Mathematically optimal decisions in forensic age
    assessment <span class="citation"
    data-cites="mostad2022mathematically">[mostad2022mathematically]</span></h3>

    <p>Forensic age estimation generally involves considerable amounts of
      uncertainty. Forensic age indicators such as teeth or skeleton images
      predict age only approximately, and this is likely to remain true even
      for future forensic age indicators. Thus, forensic age assessment should
      aim to make the best possible decisions under uncertainty. In this
      paper, we apply mathematical theory to make statistically optimal
      decisions to age assessment. Such an application is fairly
      straightforward assuming there is a standardized procedure for obtaining
      age indicator information from individuals, assuming we have data from
      the application of this procedure to a group of persons with known ages,
      and assuming the starting point for each individual is a probability
      distribution describing prior knowledge about the persons age. The main
      problem is then to obtain such a prior. Our analysis indicates that
      individual priors rather than a common prior for all persons may be
      necessary. We suggest that caseworkers, based on individual case
      information, may select a prior from a menu of priors. We show how
      information may then be collected over time to gradually increase the
      robustness of the decision procedure. We also show how replacing
      individual prior distributions for age with individual prior odds for
      being above an age limit cannot be recommended as a general method. Our
      theoretical framework is applied to data where the maturity of the
      distal femur and the third molar is observed using MRI. As part of this
      analysis we observe a weak positive conditional correlation between
    maturity of the two body parts.</p>

    <h3>2024-02-22 – Agnostic Bayesian Learning of Ensembles <span
      class="citation"
    data-cites="lacoste2014agnostic">[lacoste2014agnostic]</span></h3>
    <p>We propose a method for producing ensembles of predictors based on
      holdout estimations of their generalization performances. This approach
      uses a prior directly on the performance of predictors taken from a
      finite set of candidates and attempts to infer which one is best. Using
      Bayesian inference, we can thus obtain a posterior that represents our
      uncertainty about that choice and construct a weighted ensemble of
      predictors accordingly. This approach has the advantage of not requiring
      that the predictors be probabilistic themselves, can deal with arbitrary
      measures of performance and does not assume that the data was actually
      generated from any of the predictors in the ensemble. Since the problem
      of finding the best (as opposed to the true) predictor among a class is
      known as agnostic PAC-learning, we refer to our method as agnostic
      Bayesian learning. We also propose a method to address the case where
      the performance estimate is obtained from k-fold cross validation. While
      being efficient and easily adjustable to any loss function, our
      experiments confirm that the agnostic Bayes approach is state of the art
      compared to common baselines such as model selection based on k-fold
    cross-validation or a linear combination of predictor outputs.</p>
    <h3>2024-01-18 – Deep Learning-based Propensity Scores <span

    <figure>
      <p><img src="img/vitals-autoencoder.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Due to the non-randomized nature of real-world data, prognostic
      factors need to be balanced, which is often done by propensity scores
      (PSs). This study aimed to investigate whether autoencoders, which are
      unsupervised deep learning architectures, might be leveraged to compute
    PS.</p>

    <h3>2023-12-07 – Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning <span
      class="citation"
    data-cites="mnih2013playing">[mnih2013playing]</span></h3>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="img/atari.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn
      control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using
      reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network,
      trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and
      whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our
      method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment,
      with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find
      that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and
    surpasses a human expert on three of them.</p>

    <h3>2023-11-09 – Liquid Time-constant Networks <span class="citation"
    data-cites="hasani2021liquid">[hasani2021liquid]</span></h3>
    <p>We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network
      models. Instead of declaring a learning system’s dynamics by implicit
      nonlinearities, we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical
      systems modulated via nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models
      represent dynamical systems with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants
      coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being computed by numerical
      differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and
      bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of
      neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved
      performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these
      properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over
      their dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory
      length measure in latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of
      time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation
      capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to classical
    and modern RNNs.</p>

    <h3>2023-10-12 – Is BERT Robust to Label Noise? <span class="citation"
    data-cites="zhu2022bert">[zhu2022bert]</span></h3>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="img/bert-label-noise.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Abstract: Incorrect labels in training data occur when human
      annotators make mistakes or when the data is generated via weak or
      distant supervision. It has been shown that complex noise-handling
      techniques - by modeling, cleaning or filtering the noisy instances -
      are required to prevent models from fitting this label noise. However,
      we show in this work that, for text classification tasks with modern NLP
      models like BERT, over a variety of noise types, existing noisehandling
      methods do not always improve its performance, and may even deteriorate
      it, suggesting the need for further investigation. We also back our
    observations with a comprehensive analysis.</p>

    <h3>2023-09-14 – Active Testing: Sample–Efficient Model Evaluation <span
      class="citation"
    data-cites="kossen2021active">[kossen2021active]</span></h3>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="img/active-testing.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Abstract: We introduce a new framework for sample-efficient model
      evaluation that we call active testing. While approaches like active
      learning reduce the number of labels needed for model training, existing
      literature largely ignores the cost of labeling test data, typically
      unrealistically assuming large test sets for model evaluation. This
      creates a disconnect to real applications, where test labels are
      important and just as expensive, eg for optimizing hyperparameters.
      Active testing addresses this by carefully selecting the test points to
      label, ensuring model evaluation is sample-efficient. To this end, we
      derive theoretically-grounded and intuitive acquisition strategies that
      are specifically tailored to the goals of active testing, noting these
      are distinct to those of active learning. As actively selecting labels
      introduces a bias; we further show how to remove this bias while
      reducing the variance of the estimator at the same time. Active testing
      is easy to implement and can be applied to any supervised machine
      learning method. We demonstrate its effectiveness on models including
      WideResNets and Gaussian processes on datasets including Fashion-MNIST
    and CIFAR-100.</p>

    <h3>2023-06-08 – Using natural language and program abstractions to
    instill human inductive biases in machines <span class="citation"
    data-cites="kumar2022using">[kumar2022using]</span></h3>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="img/human-biases.png" style="width:90.0%" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Abstract: Strong inductive biases give humans the ability to quickly
      learn to perform a variety of tasks. Although meta-learning is a method
      to endow neural networks with useful inductive biases, agents trained by
      meta-learning may sometimes acquire very different strategies from
      humans. We show that co-training these agents on predicting
      representations from natural language task descriptions and programs
      induced to generate such tasks guides them toward more human-like
      inductive biases. Human-generated language descriptions and program
      induction models that add new learned primitives both contain abstract
      concepts that can compress description length. Co-training on these
      representations result in more human-like behavior in downstream
      meta-reinforcement learning agents than less abstract controls
      (synthetic language descriptions, program induction without learned
      primitives), suggesting that the abstraction supported by these
    representations is key.</p>

    <h3>2023-05-04 – Forecasting the movements of Bitcoin prices: an
    application of machine learning algorithms <span class="citation"
    data-cites="pabucccu2023forecasting">[pabucccu2023forecasting]</span></h3>
    <p>Abstract: Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are one of the most
      controversial and complex technological innovations in today’s financial
      system. This study aims to forecast the movements of Bitcoin prices at a
      high degree of accuracy. To this aim, four different Machine Learning
      (ML) algorithms are applied, namely, the Support Vector Machines (SVM),
      the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the Naive Bayes (NB) and the Random
      Forest (RF) besides the logistic regression (LR) as a benchmark model.
      In order to test these algorithms, besides existing continuous dataset,
      discrete dataset was also created and used. For the evaluations of
      algorithm performances, the F statistic, accuracy statistic, the Mean
      Absolute Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Root
      Absolute Error (RAE) metrics were used. The t test was used to compare
      the performances of the SVM, ANN, NB and RF with the performance of the
      LR. Empirical findings reveal that, while the RF has the highest
      forecasting performance in the continuous dataset, the NB has the
      lowest. On the other hand, while the ANN has the highest and the NB the
      lowest performance in the discrete dataset. Furthermore, the discrete
      dataset improves the overall forecasting performance in all algorithms
    (models) estimated.</p>
